# Problem Description

A year is considered a leap year if either of the following conditions are met:

1. The year is a multiple of 400.
2. The year is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 100.

You are given the number `year` as an argument. Implement the function `checkLeapYear` to return `"LEAP YEAR"` if it's a leap year, otherwise return `"COMMON YEAR"`.

## Hint

Write down the conditions for a leap year. Use conditional and logical operators to implement the function.

## Sample Input

```
2020
```

## Sample Output

```
LEAP YEAR
```

## Explanation

2020 is divisible by 4 and not by 100, thus it's a leap year.
