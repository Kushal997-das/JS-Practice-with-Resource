Problem Description
You are given a number n as an argument. You have to implement a function findSumOfFirstN which will add all the numbers from 1 to n and returns the sum.

Please note that the value of n will be always greater than 0.


Hint 1: Use a new variable that can be used to store and return the sum.

Hint 2: Use for-loop to iterate from 1 to n.


Sample Input 1
3


Sample Output 1
6


Explanation
For n = 3, output is 6 i.e, 1 + 2 + 3


Sample Input 2
5


Sample Output 2
15


Explanation
For n = 5, output is 15 i.e, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5


function findSumOfFirstN(n){


return sum
}

console.log(findSumOfFirstN(5))
