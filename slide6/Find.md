## Problem Description

Given an array of numbers `arr` as an argument, you need to implement the function `firstEven` which will return the first even number in the array. If there are no even numbers in the array, it should return `undefined`.

**Hint:** Use the `find` method to locate the first element in the array that satisfies the condition of being even. If no such element exists, the method returns `undefined` by default.

### Sample Input
```javascript
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Sample Output
```javascript
2
```

### Explanation
2 is the first even number in the array.
