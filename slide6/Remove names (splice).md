## Problem Description

You are given an array of strings `names`, a number `startIndex`, and a number `deleteCount` as arguments. You need to implement the function `remove` that will remove the elements from `startIndex` and the number of elements to be removed given by `deleteCount`, and returns the removed elements in the form of an array. Please note that you need to implement this problem using the `splice` method.

**Hint:** The `splice()` method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements.
