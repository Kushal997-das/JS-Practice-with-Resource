## Problem Description

You are given an array `arr` as an argument. You have to implement the function `evenCubeSum` that takes all the even numbers and finds the sum of their cubes.

If a number is multiplied by itself three times, then the product is called the cube of that number. For example, 2 cube is 2 x 2 x 2 = 8.

**Hint:** Iterate through the array using a loop and find all even numbers. For each even number found, calculate its cube and add it to the overall calculated sum.

### Sample Input

```
1, 2, 3, 4
```

### Sample Output

```
72
```

### Explanation

2 and 4 are the even numbers in the array. \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\). Both 2 and 4 are even numbers, therefore we return 72.
