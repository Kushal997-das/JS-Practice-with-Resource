## Problem Description

You are given a number `size` as an argument. You have to implement the function `createMatrixII` that:

- Creates a 2D array with the number of rows and columns equal to `size`.
- Fills each row with numbers from 0 onwards and return the 2D array.

**Hint:** Keep a counter variable and increment it after placing a value in a cell.

### Sample Input

```
2
```

### Sample Output

```
[ [ 0, 1], [ 2, 3] ]
```

### Explanation

Start from 0 and fill the matrix. We get 0, 1, 2, and 3 elements in the matrix.
