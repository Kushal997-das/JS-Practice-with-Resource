# Problem Description

You are given an array of numbers `arr`, a number `index`, and a number `ele` as arguments. You need to implement the function `replaceElement` which will modify the number at index `index` of the array to `ele`. Please note if the index is greater than (length of the array - 1), insert the element at the end of the array. But we donâ€™t have to return anything, remember how arrays are passed and if any changes are made in the passed array does it reflect in the original array? Think about it.

## Hint
Objects and Arrays are passed by reference, meaning if any changes are made in the passed Object / Array those will be reflected in the original Object / Array.

## Sample Input 1
```javascript
[7, 3, 8, 4], 2, 7
```

## Sample Output 1
```javascript
7, 3, 7, 4
```

## Explanation
The initial element at the index 2 is 8 which is replaced by the number 7.

## Sample Input 2
```javascript
[2, 4, 6, 8], 5, 10
```

## Sample Output 2
```javascript
2, 4, 6, 8, 10
```

## Explanation
Index 5 is greater than (length of array - 1). Thus we will add the number 10 to the end of the array.


## Implement the below function :

```Javascript
  function replaceElement(arr, index, ele) {
    // You only need to implement this function.
    
       
    return arr
  }

  var arr = [9, 1, 7, 4];
  console.log(replaceElement([9, 1, 3, 4], 2, 7))
```
