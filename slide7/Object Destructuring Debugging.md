# Problem Description

You have been given a function `getNameAndLocation` which should return the string containing both the properties concatenated of the object `ob` but there is an error in the code, please debug this problem. You can start by uncommenting the code given in the function and make sure we are using object destructing to unpack values from objects.

**Hint:** When we use object destructuring, the name of the variables should be the same as the key name.

```javascript
function getNameAndLocation() {
  let ob = {name: "Kushal", location: "India"};

  // write your code here
  return a + " " + b;
}

console.log(getNameAndLocation());
