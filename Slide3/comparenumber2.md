# Problem Description

You are given three numbers `a`, `b`, and `c` as arguments. You have to implement the function `isDescending` that will return `true` only if the first number is greater than the second number AND the second number is greater than the third number. Else, return `false`.

**Hint:** This is a combination of a comparison operator and a logical operator.

## Sample Input
```plaintext
10, 9, 7
```

## Sample Output
```plaintext
true
```

**Explanation:**
True, since 10 is greater than 9 and 9 is greater than 7.
