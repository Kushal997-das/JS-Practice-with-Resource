Problem Description
You are given a string str and a number k as arguments. You have to implement a function repeatString which will repeat the given string for k times. Return an empty string if k is not greater than 0. For this challenge, do not use the built-in repeat() method.


Hint: Use a while loop to add string k times.


Sample Input 1
"a", 3


Sample Output 1
"aaa"


Explanation
"a" is concatenated 3 times. Thus the returned string is “aaa”.


Sample Input 2
"ab", 4


Sample Output 2
"abababab"


Explanation
"ab" is concatenated 4 times. Thus the returned string is “abababab”.
