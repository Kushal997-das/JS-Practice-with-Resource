**Problem Description**
You are given an array of numbers arr as an argument. You need to implement the function maxMinDifference which will return a number denoting the difference between the maximum and minimum element of the array. The length of the array is at least 1 and all the elements are greater than 0.


- Hint 1: We can use Math.min and Math.max to calculate the minimum and maximum elements in the array.

- Hint 2: Traverse the complete array and keep two variables to get the minimum and maximum element and finally return their difference.

- Hint 3: Documentation of Math.min: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/min

- Hint 4: Documentation of Math.max: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/max


Sample Input
7, 3, 8, 4


Sample Output
5


> Explanation
The maximum element in the array is 8 and the minimum element is 3. The difference of 8 and 3 is 5.
