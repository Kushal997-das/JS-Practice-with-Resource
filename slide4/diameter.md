# Problem Description

You can calculate and print out expressions or variables in a template string itself. You are given the number r representing the radius of the circle as an argument.

Implement the function `circleValues` which will only have 2 lines of code in it:

1. Create a single template string variable `circle`.
2. Return the template string.

**Hint:** The template string variable `circle` should be as follows: A circle of radius r has a diameter 2*r

**Hint:** Diameter is twice the radius.

## Sample Input 1
```plaintext
2
```

## Sample Output 1
```plaintext
A circle of radius 2 has a diameter 4
```

**Explanation:**
Given radius is 2, and diameter is 2*radius, i.e., 4.

## Sample Input 2
```plaintext
3
```

## Sample Output 2
```plaintext
A circle of radius 3 has a diameter 6
```

**Explanation:**
Given radius is 3, and diameter is 2*radius, i.e., 6.
