## Problem Description

Implement the function `multiplyThree()` that:

- Accepts an array of numbers `arr` as an argument.
- Returns a new array wherein all its elements are multiplied by 3 of the given array `arr`.

**Note:** You need to implement this problem using the `map` method.

**Hint:** `.map()` is used for transforming the array and creating a new array by calling a function for every array element.

### Sample Input

```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Sample Output

[3, 6, 9, 12]
```
