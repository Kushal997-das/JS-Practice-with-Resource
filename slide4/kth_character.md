# Problem Description

You are given a string `str` and a number `k` as arguments. You need to return the kth character of that string from the start.

**Hint:** The first character of a string is at index 0, the second character at index 1, and so on.

**Hint:** The kth character in a string is at index k-1.

## Sample Input
```plaintext
abcdef, 3
```

## Sample Output
```plaintext
c
```

**Explanation:**
The third character of the string "abcdef" is 'c'. Notice 'c' is the third character at index 3-1 = 2 because indexing starts from 0.
