# Problem Description

You are given two numbers `age` and `weight`. You have to implement a function that will determine if the given age is eligible for blood donation or not. If the age is less than 18, return "UnderAge". If the age is more than 18, but weight is less than or equal to 50, return "NotEligible". If the age is more than 18, and weight is more than 50, return 'Eligible'.

**Hint:** List down multiple conditions and explore nested if-else.

## Sample Input

```plaintext
25, 55
```

## Sample Output

```plaintext
Eligible
```

**Explanation:**
As age is greater than 18 and weight is greater than 50, thus "Eligible".
