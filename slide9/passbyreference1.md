# Problem Description

You are given an array of numbers `arr` as an argument. You need to implement the function `manipulatingArray` which will modify the numbers of the array such that if the number is even, it adds 5 else it multiplies 5. But we donâ€™t have to return anything, remember how arrays are passed and if any changes are made in the passed array does it reflect in the original array? Think about it.

**Hint:** Objects and Arrays are passed by reference, meaning if any changes are made in the passed Object / Array those will be reflected in the original Object / Array.

## Sample Input
```javascript
7, 3, 8, 4
```

## Sample Output
```javascript
35, 15, 13, 9
```

**Explanation:**
7 is odd and thus it is multiplied by 5 and the new value becomes 35.

3 is odd and thus it is multiplied by 5 and the new value becomes 15.

8 is even and thus it is added by 5 and the new value becomes 13.

4 is even and thus it is added by 5 and the new value becomes 9.
