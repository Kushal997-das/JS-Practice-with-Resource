# Problem Description

You are given three numbers `a`, `b`, and `c` as arguments. You have to implement the function `compareNumbers` such that EITHER the first number is equal to the second OR the second number is equal to the third, return `true`. Else, return `false`.

**Hint:** This is a combination of a comparison operator and a logical operator.

## Sample Input
```plaintext
10, 99, 99
```

## Sample Output
```plaintext
true
```

**Explanation:**
The second number (99) and the third number (99) are equal, hence `true`.
