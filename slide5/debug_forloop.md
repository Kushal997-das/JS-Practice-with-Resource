# Problem Description

You have been given a function `findSum` which returns the sum of numbers from 1 to n but there is an error in the code, please debug this problem. You can start by uncommenting the code given in the function. Please note that the value of n will be greater than 0.

**Hint 1:** Whenever we use loops, we have to make sure that we give proper terminating conditions.

**Hint 2:** Understand why infinite loops happen. Try printing `i` and `sum` in each iteration to figure out what is going wrong.

```javascript
function findSum(n) {

  // let i = 1;
  // let sum = 0;
  // while(i <= n){
  //   sum += i;
  // }
  // return sum;
}
console.log(findSum(10))
