# Problem Description

You are given the number `n` as an argument. You have to implement the function `findFactorial` which will return the factorial of the given number `n`.

A factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

**Hint 1:** We can use loops to solve this problem.

**Hint 2:** 0! is equal to 1.

## Sample Input 1

```plaintext
5
```

## Sample Output 1

```plaintext
120
```

**Explanation:**
5 factorial is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5, i.e., 120.

## Sample Input 2

```plaintext
6
```

## Sample Output 2

```plaintext
720
```

**Explanation:**
6 factorial is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6, i.e., 720.
