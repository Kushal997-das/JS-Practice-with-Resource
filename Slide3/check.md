# Problem Description

You are given two numbers `a` and `b` as arguments. You have to implement the function `isEqual` that will return `true` if the numbers are equal, else return `false`.

**Hint:** Use the comparison operator (`===`).

**Hint:** Comparison operators return a boolean value. Use a new variable which can be used to store and return the result.

**Hint:** You can also use "if else" to solve this problem.

## Sample Input
```plaintext
89, 11
```

## Sample Output
```plaintext
false
```

**Explanation:**
89 is not equal to 11, so return `false`.
