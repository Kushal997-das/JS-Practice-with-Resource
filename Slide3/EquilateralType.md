# Problem Description

You are given three numbers `side1`, `side2`, and `side3` as arguments. You have to implement the function `isEquilateralType` that will return `true` if all the sides are equal, else it will return `false`.

**Note:** All the sides will be greater than 0, i.e., `side1 > 0`, `side2 > 0`, and `side3 > 0`.

**Hint:** Equilateral means values of `side1`, `side2`, and `side3` should be equal.

## Sample Input
```plaintext
9, 9, 9
```

## Sample Output
```plaintext
true
```

**Explanation:**
All the sides are equal; therefore, the output is `true`.
