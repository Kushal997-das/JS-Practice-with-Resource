Problem Description
You can calculate and print out expressions or variables in a template string itself.


You are given the number r representing the radius of the circle as an argument.

You need to implement the function circleValues which will only have 2 lines of code in it:

Create a single template string variable circle.

Return the template string.


Hint: The template string variable circle should be as follows: A circle of radius r has a diameter 2*r

Hint: Diameter is twice the radius.


Sample Input 1
2


Sample Output 1
A circle of radius 2 has a diameter 4


Explanation
Given radius is 2 and diameter is 2*radius i.e 4.


Sample Input 2
3


Sample Output 2
A circle of radius 3 has a diameter 6


Explanation
Given radius is 3 and diameter is 2*radius i.e 6.
