## Problem Description

Implement the function `search()` that:

- Accepts two arguments: an array of numbers `arr` and a number `key`.
- Returns a boolean:
  - `true`, if the `key` is present in the given array `arr`.
  - `false`, otherwise.

**Note:** Use the `for..each` loop to iterate through the array.

### Sample Input 1

```
[1, 2, 3, 4], 0
```

### Sample Output 1

```
false
```

### Explanation

0 is not present in the array hence the output is false.

### Sample Input 2

```
[10, 20, 30, 40, 50], 50
```

### Sample Output 2

```
true
```

### Explanation

50 is present in the array hence the output is true.
```
